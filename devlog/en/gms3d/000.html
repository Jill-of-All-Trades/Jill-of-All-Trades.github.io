          Hello again! I'm Nick, a software engineer and hobbyst game developer. 
          Recently, I decided to share the experience I've gained over several years of developing video games. I hope you will find it useful!
          <br><br>
          In this article, I'll cover the basic concepts of creating 3D games. 
          Unlike most 3D engines, such as Unity, Godot or UE, Gamemaker does not have extensive 3D support. 
          To display any 3D object, you need to assemble it yourself and run it through a special shader. 
          But first things first.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="001" class="yomogi-regular">
        <p class="subheader">What is a 3D object</p>

        <div class="section-important">
          <img src="../../../img/mayuri-important.png" alt="Important!" class="left-image icon-size">
            <div class="text-size-def">
              Any <span class="hg_green">3D object</span> is <span class="hg_green">a sequential set of vertices</span> 
              which is called <span class="hg_yellow">Vertex Buffer</span>. 
              Each <span class="hg_green">vertex</span> includes a certain <span class="hg_green">sequential set of information</span>, 
              such as - a position in the world space (X, Y, Z coordinates), normal vector, texture UV-coordinates, and so on. 
              The rules that specify what must be stored at a vertex are called <span class="hg_yellow">Vertex Format</span>.
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="text-size-def">
          To display any 3D object, all vertices must have at least a position in 3D space - X, Y, and Z coordinates.
          The X, Y, Z values are represented by floating-point numbers (like <span class="text-code">10,5</span>).<br>
          For example, let's take <span class="hg_green">four vertices storing coordinates</span> shown in the image below.
          Using them, we will assemble the simplest <span class="hg_green">square</span> (yes, it can also be in 3D, although it's an ordinary plane).
        </p>

        <p class="subheader">How to build 3D objects</p>

        <p class="text-size-def">
          Great! We have vertices. But to make a full square we still need <span class="hg_green">edges</span>.
          And here the <span class="hg_green">order in which the vertices are stored</span> in the <span class="hg_yellow">Vertex Buffer</span> begins to play a role.
          <br><br>
          Before sending our square to the renderer (GPU), we must tell the computer <span class="hg_green">what primitive it should build</span> - 
          <span class="hg_yellow">points, straight lines, triangles,</span> or <span class="hg_yellow">quads</span>. There are others, but we'll limit ourselves to these for now.
          <br><br>
          After that, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">GPU will sequentially go through each vertex in the order in which they are in the vertex buffer</span> and build the required primitive.
          <br><br>
          To better understand what I'm talking about, let's index the vertices in the order in which they would be in the buffer, 
          and see what the result will look like with different primitives.
        </p>
        
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px;">
          <img src="../../../img/explains/vertex-lines.gif" alt="Vertex Lines" class="picture" style="width: 256px; height: 256px;">
          <img src="../../../img/explains/vertex-trian.gif" alt="Vertex Lines" class="picture" style="width: 256px; height: 256px;">
          <img src="../../../img/explains/vertex-quad.gif" alt="Vertex Lines" class="picture" style="width: 256px; height: 256px;">
        </div>
        
        <div class="section-important">
          <img src="../../../img/kurisu.png" alt="Make a point!" class="left-image icon-size">
          <div class="text-size-def">
            Yes, I specifically skipped the point primitive, because it will render... points. 
            This primitive is used in quite rare cases, for example, to display some particles, build dynamic geometry or in point clouds for 3D mapping.
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="text-size-def">
          Note that if we try to construct a triangle, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">extra vertex will simply be discarded</span>.<br><br>
          Cool! It would seem that in order to build a square we should use the Quad primitive. But there is a nuance that concerns the GameMaker engine...
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">It still does not support this type of primitive</span>. *facepalm*
          <br><br>
          So what to do now? The solution is very simple - <span class="hg_green">a square can be built from two triangles</span>.
          We will have two triangles - with vertex indexes <span class="hg_yellow">1, 2, 3</span> and <span class="hg_yellow">1, 3, 4</span>.
          <br><br>
          But for this we will have to copy vertices <span class="hg_yellow">1 and 3</span> to the vertex buffer. 
          So instead of <span style="font-weight: bold;">4 vertices</span> in the buffer we will have <span style="font-weight: bold;">6</span>.<br>
          The final sequence will be as follows - <span class="hg_yellow">1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4</span>.      
        </p>

        <div class="section-important">
          <img src="../../../img/kurisu.png" alt="Make a point!" class="left-image icon-size">
          <div class="text-size-def">
            Someone might ask:<br> <span class="text-code" style="font-weight: bold;">Why did you choose the sequence 1,2,3 and 1,3,4 instead of, for example, 3,1,2 and 4,3,1?</span> 
            <span class="text-code" style="font-weight: bold;">After all, they also form the same triangles!</span><br>
            And that's right. However, <span class="hg_green">whether the triangle is formed clockwise or vice versa is very important for optimizing the rendering of 3D models</span>. 
            I will talk about this in another article, which will be released later.
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="text-size-def">
          In fact, the triangular primitive is the most common in 3D graphics. From it, you can build an object of almost any complexity.
          And the difference between 4 and 6 vertices is not great.
          <br><br>
          But what if we're going to load an object into the game that has <span style="font-weight: bold;">100,000</span> triangles? 
          A lot of the vertices will just be repeated, taking up extra GPU memory.
          For this purpose, an another buffer was invented - the <span class="hg_green">Index Buffer</span>.
        </p>

        <div class="section-important">
          <img src="../../../img/mayuri-important.png" alt="Important!" class="left-image icon-size">
            <div class="text-size-def">
              <span class="hg_green">Index Buffer</span> is <span class="hg_green">a sequential set of vertex indexes (integers)</span> in the vertex buffer. 
              If you attach it during rendering, the GPU will sequentially take vertices according to this buffer. 
              And there is no need for duplication or sequence of vertices in the vertex buffer.
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="text-size-def">
          This seems to be the solution. But developers on the GameMaker engine are again faced with a problem - 
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">index buffers are not supported either</span>. *facepalm x2*<br>
          And unfortunately, this is something you will have to live with (at least for now). 
          So choose your models wisely, look at how many vertices they contain, and what these vertices store.
